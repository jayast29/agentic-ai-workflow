# Agentic AI Workflow Orchestration (A2A)

A multi-agent system demonstrating **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication**, where autonomous AI agents coordinate, negotiate constraints, and schedule shared resources using tool-driven workflows.

This project simulates a real-world coordination problem using a fun **Avengers-themed scenario**, while showcasing **production-relevant agentic AI patterns**.

### 🎯 Project Goal

To demonstrate how multiple AI agents, built using different agent frameworks, can:

- Communicate autonomously using A2A-style messaging
- Coordinate tasks across agents with isolated state
- Negotiate constraints (availability, conflicts)
- Use tools to make decisions
- Reduce manual coordination efforts

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Similar to how human assistants collaborate to schedule meetings:

- Each agent owns its **own context, memory, and tools**
- A coordinator aggregates responses from multiple agents
- Decisions are made **collaboratively**, not through hard-coded logic

This mirrors real **enterprise agent orchestration** and workflow automation use cases.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

#### Agent Roles

| Agent | Framework | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **Thor Agent** | LangChain | Manages Thor’s availability and responds to scheduling queries |
| **Stark Agent** | CrewAI | Manages Stark’s schedule and performs constraint negotiation |
| **Cap Agent** | Google ADK | Coordinates agents via A2A-style messaging and aggregates decisions |
